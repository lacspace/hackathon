      "summary" : "Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) are key enzymes that catabolize thiopurines. Decreased or no-function alleles in TPMT and NUDT15 are associated with reduced or no enzyme activity and predictive of pronounced adverse effects, including severe myelosuppression, that may occur among individuals treated with standard doses of thiopurines. Genetic variants in these genes are present in all world populations; however, their frequency varies by ancestry. In this updated guideline, we provide recommendations for adjusting starting doses of mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and azathioprine based on TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes, including for individuals with variants in both genes (updates on www.clinpgx.org).",

Although all three medications share many of the same pharmacologic effects, mercaptopurine and azathioprine are generally used for nonmalignant immunologic disorders, and mercaptopurine and thioguanine are used for hematological malignancies. Because azathioprine is converted to mercaptopurine in cells, the two drugs can be considered to have identical interactions with TPMT and NUDT15. &quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;TPMT catabolizes mercaptopurine to an inactive methylmercaptopurine base, leaving less parent drug available for potential anabolism to pharmacologically active thioguanine nucleotides.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Through agnostic genome-­wide association studies, variants in NUDT15 were identified that strongly influence thiopurine tolerance in patients with ALL and IBD.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;There is substantial evidence linking TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes with phenotypic variability in thiopurine response\n(see Tables S1 and S2).
